##I designed and developed a personal portfolio website to showcase my skills, projects, and professional journey as a Full Stack Developer. This website serves as an interactive platform where visitors can learn about my expertise, experience, and the projects I have worked on. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the site ensures a modern, responsive, and user-friendly experience.

Technology Stack & Design Approach
The website is structured using HTML for content organization, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactive elements. To enhance the design and responsiveness, I integrated Bootstrap Icons for seamless UI components and used CSS media queries to optimize the site for different screen sizes. The website maintains a clean and intuitive navigation system, allowing users to explore sections like Home, About, Projects, and Contact effortlessly.

Key Features & Sections
Navigation Bar & Responsive Menu
The navigation bar is designed for easy access to different sections of the website. On smaller screens, the menu transforms into a hamburger icon, which expands when clicked. This feature ensures a seamless browsing experience across various devices.

Hero Section (Introduction)
The homepage features a self-introduction with a visually appealing gradient background. This section introduces me as a Java Full Stack Developer and highlights my ability to build dynamic and scalable applications. Accompanied by a profile image, this section sets a professional tone for visitors.

About Section
The About section provides an overview of my background, including my final-year Computer Science and Engineering studies at PBR VITS. It highlights my technical skills in Java, C, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, along with my passion for Full Stack Development. This section also emphasizes my project experience, such as the Hotel Management System, Natural Language to SQL Translation, and Medicine Reminder Application, showcasing my problem-solving abilities and teamwork skills.

Projects Showcase
The Projects section presents some of the key software solutions I have developed. Each project is displayed within an interactive card-based layout, featuring a brief description of its purpose and technology stack. The showcased projects include:

Online Book Store – A web-based platform enabling users to browse and purchase books, built using Java Servlets, JSP, and MySQL.
Brain Tumor Detection – A machine learning model using CNN to assist in the early detection of brain tumors.
Expense Tracker – A web application that helps users manage their expenses efficiently with an intuitive UI.
E-commerce Site – A work-in-progress project focused on online shopping functionalities.
Contact Section
The Contact section provides direct links for reaching out, including email and LinkedIn. These links are accompanied by Bootstrap icons to enhance the visual appeal and usability.

Responsive Design & User Experience
The website is designed to be fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. Media queries ensure optimized layouts, such as adjusting the navigation menu, image positioning, and project displays based on screen size. The scroll-behavior property enables smooth navigation between sections.
